# N-Bit-Adder
This Scheme program calculates the sum of arbitrarily large binary numbers by simulating an N-bit Adder Circuit by recursively using a Full Adder function constructed by AND, OR, XOR logic gates

### Logic Design 
## Full Adder

A 1-bit adder circuit takes in three inputs of 1 bit each, where "a" and "b" are operands to be added and "Cin" is the carry-in value. The inputs go through a series of logic gates to generate two output values of "S" which is the sum bit and "Cout" which is the carry-out value. 
The program displays a complete truth table of each logic gate and a full adder.
