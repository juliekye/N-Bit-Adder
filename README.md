# N-Bit-Adder
This Scheme program calculates the sum of arbitrarily large binary numbers by simulating an N-bit Adder Circuit by recursively using a Full Adder function constructed by AND, OR, XOR logic gates

## Logic Design 
### Full Adder 
![full adder](https://www.elprocus.com/wp-content/uploads/Full-Adder-Logical-Diagram.png) <br/>
A 1-Bit Adder circuit takes in three inputs of 1 bit each, where "a" and "b" are operands to be added and "Cin" is the carry-in value. The inputs go through a series of logic gates to generate two output values of "S" which is the sum bit and "Cout" which is the carry-out value. 
The program displays a complete truth table of each logic gate and a Full Adder.

### N-Bit Adder
![n-bit adder](https://nandland.com/vhdl/modules/images/ripple-carry-adder-4-bit.png) <br/>
An N-bit Adder is sequence of N connected Full Adders where the carry-out value generated by the previous circuit is the carry-in for the next. This is useful for the addition of binary numbers with an arbitrarily large number of bits. 

## Usage 
A user may provide two arbitrary large binary numbers each of length N to be added using the N-Bit Adder and expect an output of the final carry-out value followed by the rest of the sum. <br/>
The binary numbers must be defined within the program as lists in Scheme. <br/>
After defining these lists, the n-bit-adder function must be called in this format:  n-bit-adder(list1, list2, n) <br/>
with the predefined lists as parameters and n being the length of the numbers.  <br/>
There are comments at the end of the file denoting where a user may create test cases. If the numbers provided are of different lengths this error message will print in place of the output: "Error: The numbers entered must have the same number of bits". <br/>
Here there are default test cases of varying lengths to demonstrate the N-Bit Adder on 4, 8, 16, and 32 bit binary numbers. <br/>
